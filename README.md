# Image Sense

**Image Sense** is a web-based image classification application built using **Flask** and **MobileNetV2**, a pre-trained deep learning model from TensorFlow. This application allows users to upload images and returns the top predicted label along with a confidence score.

## Features

- Upload any image and receive a prediction on its classification.
- Uses **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight deep learning model trained on the **ImageNet** dataset.
- Displays the predicted class and the confidence percentage.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Demo

Hereâ€™s how the app works:

1. User uploads an image via a form.
2. The image is processed using **MobileNetV2**.
3. The top prediction and confidence score are displayed on the screen.
